# ðŸ§  Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - NLP Class by Andrej Karpathy

This repository contains my implementation of a simple **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network, as part of [Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) YouTube series on building neural networks from scratch for NLP.

## ðŸ“š Lecture Reference

This MLP follows the logic and flow explained in the "Building MLPs" part of the [Zero to Hero: Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpHX4lLxL3UeTz-n4J7LkU_GX5x0Y0R4D) series by Karpathy.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Trains an MLP from scratch ( PyTorch )
- Implements forward pass, loss computation, and backward pass (autograd manually)
- Uses a names.txt character-level dataset
- Predicts the next character/token based on input sequences
